# 👋 Hi, I'm Siyanda Mthethwa

🎓 I'm an IT student passionate about **Cybersecurity**

# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab & Projects

Welcome to my Cybersecurity workspace — a collection of CTFs, custom tools, notes, and hands-on experiments. This is where I learn by doing, breaking, fixing, and documenting.

## 🏠 Homelab Setup

My current homelab is built around a **Kali Linux Virtual Machine** running on **Oracle VirtualBox**. It’s a lightweight, personal environment where I explore and practice ethical hacking techniques.

### 🔧 Environment Overview

- **Host OS:** Windows 10
- **Virtualization Software:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Guest OS:** Kali Linux (latest rolling release)
- **Allocated Resources:**
  - RAM: 16GB
  - CPU Cores: 4 cores
  - Disk: 20 GB dynamically allocated

### 🔨 Tools Installed in Kali

- **Recon:** Nmap, Amass, Ike-scan, Legion, Recon-ng, Zenmap, Spiderfoot
- **Web Testing:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Dirb, Gobuster, Webshells, Wpscan
- **Exploitation:** Metasploit, sqlmap, Nikto, Msfpc, Netexsc
- **Password Attacks:** Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat, Medusa, Ncrack
- **Network Analysis:** Wireshark, tcpdump
- **Custom Scripts:** Python, Bash utilities (see [`Tools/`](./Tools))

📂 [`Homelab/`](./Homelab)
- `setup.md`: How I installed and configured Kali
- `tools.md`: My personal tool stack and why I use them
- `experiments/`: Hands-on logs (vuln testing, packet captures, etc.)

## 🎯 Capture The Flag (CTF)

I actively solve challenges on platforms like:
- **TryHackMe** (Offensive Pentesting Path)
- **Hack The Box** (Starting Point & Tier I machines)
- **PicoCTF** (Web and binary exploitation practice)

📂 [`CTFs/`](./CTFs)
- Room writeups and walkthroughs
- Vulnerability exploitation techniques
- Custom payloads and scripts used

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Scripts

I build and maintain small scripts to automate tasks and assist in recon or exploitation.

📂 [`Tools/`](./Tools)
- Python: Port scanners, directory brute-forcers, parsers
- Bash: Automation for common recon tasks
- PoCs: For known vulnerabilities and CVEs I study

## 📚 Notes & Learning

📂 [`Notes/`](./Notes)
- Privilege escalation notes (Linux & Windows)
- Web vulnerabilities: XSS, SQLi, SSRF, etc.
- Linux basics, enumeration tactics
- Incident response and log review practice

---

## 📜 Certifications & Learning Paths

- 🎯 TryHackMe: Offensive Pentesting Path (In Progress)
- 🧩 Hack The Box: Starting Point Machines (Ongoing)
- 📘 CompTIA Security+ (Planned)
- 🧠 Always exploring new tools and attack vectors
